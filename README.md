# AMATH-353-HW
These are my homework files for AMATH 353: Partial Differential Equations. 

To quote the syllabus, the course "Covers traveling waves of linear equations, dispersion relation, stability, superposition and Fourier analysis, d'Alembert solution, standing waves, vibrations and separation of variables, traveling waves of nonlinear equations, conservation laws, characteristics, breaking, shocks, and rarefaction."

Various aspects of that blurb can be found throughout the various plots and matlab files in this folder.
